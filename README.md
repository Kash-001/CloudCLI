# CloudCLI

**CloudCLI** is a Python-based command-line tool designed for simulating and managing virtual networks with ease and flexibility. 

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently in development, with the following features planned:

- **Device Simulation**: Build and configure virtual switches, routers, firewalls, PCs, and datacenters.
- **Network Connections**: Establish connections between devices to create a functional network topology.
- **Protocol Support**: Implement essential networking protocols like BGP for datacenter interconnection, VLANs for network segmentation, and more.
- **Interactive CLI**: Manage your network with intuitive commands in a streamlined interface.
- **Gamified Learning**: Experiment with network design in a fun, educational way.

Stay tuned for updates as we build the future of network simulation!
